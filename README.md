# Astrometry-from-CCD-Images
The goal of this report is to employ methods of Astrometry in order to track the proper motion of the moving asteroid 26 Proserpina in the span of 5-6 days. Several CCD images are taken of the asteroid using DIT telescope on each day of the raw, dark, flat, and bias data. Through flat fielding and taking the median values on each day respectful to their exposure times, clearer data is revealed to plot the pixel positions in the images through taking centroids of intensity. USNO stars are taken from the website of the data according to the header positions of the stars to see the match and calibration between the two sets of data and the residual of offsets. Plate constants are calculated through matrices to account for shear, magnification, rotation, and translation of the images. This is followed by finding the T matrix based on the focal value given in the lab, 3454, and then using it to find a new focal value to calculate another T matrix. Through the comparison of 4 images of CCD on DS9 program, one must be able to locate the moving asteroid amid stationary background stars. After determining the pixel coordinates of the asteroid on each day, the units are changed to standard coordinates followed by celestial coordinates (RA, Dec). The arc length and time passage are calculated between the 4 values to determine the 4 proper motions. The path is expected to be a curve in the sky.
